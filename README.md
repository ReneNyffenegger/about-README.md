# Heading with one hash

## Heading with two hashes

### Heading with three hashes

#### For hashes

Normal text:

Normal text can use *stars* and _underscores_ and *_both_* (yet, both are rendered as italics).
With **double stars**, the text turns bold, with **_double stars and an underscore_** it turns bold and italic.
Text between ~~two tildes~~ is stroken through. This is text `enclosed in back-ticks`.

And then, there are also [links](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-README.md/master/README.md).
Normal urls (such as www.github.com) are rendered as links as well.

    This seems to be like code.

    It needs at least for whitespaces
    at a line's beginning

A table. Note the rigth and left alignment (by means of the *colons*):

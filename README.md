Normal text:

Normal text can use *stars* (`*text*`) and _underscores_ (`_text_`) and *_both_* (`*_text_*`), yet, both are rendered as italics.
With **double stars** (`**text**`), the text turns bold, with **_double stars and an underscore_** (`**_text_**`) it turns bold and italic.
Text between ~~two tildes~~ (`~~text~~`) is stroken through. This is text `enclosed in back-ticks` (`\`text\``).

And then, there are also [links](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-README.md/master/README.md).
Normal urls (such as www.github.com) are rendered as links as well.

    This seems to be like code.

    It needs at least for whitespaces
    at a line's beginning

A table. Note the rigth and left alignment (by means of the *colons*):

|     3|three  |drei   |

# Links in code

Links in code don't work:

     function FooBar(a, b) {

        return a + b;  // [github](www.github.com)

     }
